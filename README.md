### Welcome
This is a fork of Eric's Dynamic Market. I'm looking to tweak it more towards what I see in it, and to allow for a greater degree of customisation. I have 0 Java or OOP language experience, so I'm using this as pratice.

### What I hope to achieve
- XML based storage
- Ability to self generate recipes and costs
- Ability to tweak stock
- More to come?

### Install Steps
- The Folder `Dynamic Market` should be put into the plugins folder of the server. It contains the data about recipies that is loaded by the plugin on startup.
- The file `DynamicMarketplace.jar` should be put into the plugins folder of the server
- Information about configuring the plugin is in the CONFIG.txt in Dynamic Marketplace

### Accessing Source
- Do whatever you like with my source for this project, just credit me
- The entire project is in the source folder and should run in any ide with maven
- Run `mvn install` when in the `source` directory and it should generate a build of the plugin
- The classes and files are in `source/main/java`
